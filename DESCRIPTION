Title: Bayesian Analysis to Compare Models using Resampling Statistics
Description: Models that have been resampled in the same way can be compared using a Bayesian analysis that accounts for the resample-to-resample variability. The posterior distributions of the performance criterion, or of the parameter differences between models, can be easily computed, summarized, and visualized.
